# Brain Tumor Detection Using Deep Learning Techniques
## üìå Overview
This project focuses on the automated detection of brain tumors from MRI images using deep learning techniques. Multiple models were implemented and evaluated, including VGG-19, ResNet, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), and Deep Belief Network (DBN). The objective was to identify the most accurate and reliable model for classifying brain tumors from MRI scans.

## üß© Dataset
The dataset consists of a total of 253 Brain MRI images, organized into two categories:

Yes Folder (155 images): Contains MRI images diagnosed with brain tumors.

No Folder (98 images): Contains MRI images with no tumors (healthy).

This balanced but moderately sized dataset allows for binary classification of brain tumor presence based on image inputs.

## üìä Models and Accuracy
The table below summarizes the training and testing accuracy scores achieved by each model:
